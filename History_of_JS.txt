In 1995 we have a popular web browser name as "Netscape Navigator".
They want a language which work on to add interactivity to their websites.

"Brendan Eich" working for them, they made JavaScript within 10 days.
Starting js is known as Mocha,then LiveScript. But not get attention or not used by users.

Then they named as LiveScript as JavaScript because on that day Java is too popular language.

LiveScript ---> JavaScript

After that, due to popularity of JavaScript. In 1996, Internet Explorer invented another programming language known as "Jscript"

Now
Netscape Navigator 2 browser have JavaScript.
Internet Explorer brwoser have JScript.
We have two programming languages.

created issues(problem):-
If we use JavaScript then my website is looking good on Netscape browser.

Then JavaScript handed To "ECMA" 
ECMA is an international organisation, which standarized different technologies, they decided that how technology behaves and how they work.

ECMA international standards organisation, now every browser should follow the rules. Runs JavaScript on every browser.
ECMA decided how to js technology works and its behaviour.
Js was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.

Internet Explorer(IE4) was first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition(ES1)
